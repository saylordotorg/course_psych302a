**Unit 4: Adolescent Development** <span id="4"></span> 
*Child development and adolescent development are not necessarily
distinct from one another; many of the processes that begin to take
place toward later childhood (especially in terms of cognitive and
personality development) will continue throughout adolescence. This is
important to keep in mind, as in this unit, we focus on developmental
changes and issues that are especially important if not unique to
adolescence. As is well-known, adolescent development is characterized
by rapid physical changes, including inward and outward signs of
puberty; it is also marked by significant changes in the physical
structure of the brain. Also, despite the continuity from childhood in
some aspects of cognitive development, there are also some rather sudden
changes in this domain. For example, as we will consider in-depth in one
subunit, these changes often give way to shifts in how individuals think
about moral dilemmas.  *  
  
 *It is important to note that while adolescent development does involve
a number of changes, these changes typically follow a systematic, or
orderly, pattern. We have become increasingly aware of these patterns
thanks to the recent discoveries concerning the physical changes that
occur during this time (i.e., puberty) and the different psychological
changes that these bring about.*  
  
 *As in the unit on child development, we focus in turn on development
in the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional domains. *
