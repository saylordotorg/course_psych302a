**Unit 3: Child Development** <span id="3"></span> 
*While the development process is unique to every individual, there are
certain milestones that children reach in the course of normal
development in their first few years. This unit begins by identifying
these milestones and other expectations, with a focus on motor
development and discussing what it means when these milestones are
delayed or expectations are not met. It is important to note that these
are just expectations – not requirements – for normal development.*  
  
 *The unit then turns to cognitive development or changes in how
individuals think and gain knowledge over time. This unit will focus on
cognitive development in childhood (birth to about 11 years), but there
is a growing body of literature on cognitive development in adolescence
and adulthood, some of which will be addressed in later units. In
childhood, cognitive processes are only beginning to take shape; the way
they develop can dramatically affect our cognitive abilities as we
further mature. Within the subunit on cognitive development, there will
be special foci on the development of intelligence and of language.
Intelligence, which is typically measured through an IQ (intelligence
quotient), is reportedly a stable measure. But since we clearly gain
more intelligence over our lifespan, how does the IQ remain stable over
time? This is one of the key questions explored herein. Language is also
one of the most complex human phenomena that psychologists study. When
we talk about language in this unit, we do not just mean the audible
aspect of it (though that is certainly a part of it) – we also mean the
written word, grammar, sentence construction, and, of course, our
ability to communicate meaning with it. Please note that many of the
theories and explanations surrounding language development that we will
learn in this unit have not been completely substantiated. You should
ask yourself the extent to which these theories accurately and fully
explain language development, identifying where they seem to fall
short.*  
  
 *The last major subunit will concern personality and socio-emotional
development. Psychologists find it difficult to accurately and
consistently test for personality traits and continue to refine their
theories about the key elements and developmental trends of personality.
As a result, little in the subfield of personality development is set in
stone. Personality development research generally begins with the
concept of infant temperament (or the way a baby behaves at an early
age). Many psychologists are interested in how well early temperament
predicts later personality traits. As you will learn, the relationship
of temperament to an adult’s personality is tenuous at best, in part
because of the various environmental factors contributing to personality
development, from the type of early attachment bonds formed with
caregivers to long-term exposure to a particular parenting style. *
