**Unit 2: Foundations of Development** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will focus on the biological foundations of life and the very
first stage of human development: prenatal development, which takes
place in the womb. Our understanding of prenatal development has grown a
lot in recent years due to medical and technological innovations.
Because much of our development in this stage is the result of physical
transformations, these innovations have given us a much greater insight
into the physical maturation of a fetus. However, there are a number of
mental changes that the fetus undergoes (mostly due to brain growth).
While this unit will focus primarily on the physical changes, it is
important to recognize that these physical changes may play a role in
the infant’s psychological development. *  
  
 *The unit begins with an overview of genetic (nature) and environmental
(nurture) influences on the beginnings of development and then presents
the processes of prenatal development, with special focus on the brain.
How do the processes of prenatal development enable the immediate
survival of the newborn in the world? The unit concludes with a peek at
the newborn’s critical sensory capacities and the newborn’s reflexive
responses.  *
