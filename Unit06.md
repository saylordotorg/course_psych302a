**Unit 6: The End of Life: Death and Grieving** <span id="6"></span> 
*A course on lifespan development would be incomplete without
considering how humans perceive and cope with the end of life.* *Reflect
for a minute on your earliest memories of dealing with the death of a
family member, friend, or even a beloved pet.* *What did you think it
meant when you heard that this person or animal had died? Did you
understand that death is permanent and universal?* *What emotions did
you experience and how did you express your grief? Now think about how
your understanding of and feelings about death have changed as you have
progressed through childhood to your current stage of life.* *As this
unit will illustrate, there are many commonalities in how individuals
perceive death at particular stages of the lifespan and in how people
cope with the process of dying or with the loss of loved ones.* *But, as
with development in any domain, there is also much individual variation
in perceptions and feelings regarding death, reflective of variation in
personality traits as well as in individual and cultural influences.*  
    
 *This unit begins with a broad consideration of the meaning of death
and of developmental trends in our understanding of death from childhood
through adulthood.* *Next, the unit examines common feelings about and
ways of coping with dying, with special attention to the theory of
Kübler-Ross and criticisms of that theory and to issues especially
relevant in the last weeks and days of life.* *The unit concludes with a
look at contemporary research on the grieving process.*
