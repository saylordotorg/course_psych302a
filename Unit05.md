**Unit 5: Adult Development** <span id="5"></span> 
*In the previous unit, we talked about how we develop as adolescents.
This unit will look at the development that takes place during true
adulthood. You should note that while various stages of development are
aligned with certain ages, these age distinctions are just guidelines;
some may suggest that adolescence ends (and adulthood begins) at 18
years, but there is no scientific evidence to substantiate this
distinction. This notion becomes important when taking a look at adult
development, because different developmental patterns can begin at
different times for different adults. While early adulthood, middle
adulthood, and late adulthood are roughly considered 18 to 40 years, 40
to 65 years, and 65 years-plus, for the purposes of this unit, we will
largely leave age distinctions alone and focus instead on the
developmental patterns themselves. While adulthood clearly comprises the
largest portion of our lives, it may be the least-studied of the
developmental stages.*  
  
 *This unit will help you recognize how individuals are *constantly
changing and adapting based on earlier development.* As in previous
units, you will begin by exploring physical development, continue with
cognitive development, and conclude with consideration of key issues in
personality and socio-emotional development. As you progress through the
unit, ask yourself this: What sorts of connections can I identify
between development in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood?*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 13 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 3.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: .75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 8.75 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   explain why it is important to continue studying and learning about
    development into early, middle, and late adulthood;
-   describe the effects of aging on physical and cognitive development;
-   discuss three common problems faced by those in late adulthood:
    ageism, poverty, elder abuse;
-   discuss Erickson’s adulthood conflicts of intimacy versus isolation,
    generativity versus stagnation, and integrity versus despair;
-   discuss the significance of transition phases in adult development,
    such as from adolescence to early adulthood and the midlife
    transition;
-   summarize the findings of research on the concept of a “midlife
    crisis;”
-   discuss the role of attachment in adult personality development;
-   discuss the role of marriage and divorce in adult development;
-   discuss the impacts of aging on individuals’ personal and social
    development and the broader society; and
-   identify and explain the three main theoretical perspectives on the
    aging process (functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic
    interactionism).
