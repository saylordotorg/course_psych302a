**Unit 1: Introduction to Lifespan Development** <span id="1"></span> 
*In order to help you build a firm base from which to explore the
details of developmental processes, milestones, and stages, this unit
will introduce you to central issues, theories, and methods in the study
of lifespan development. While myriad theories historically and
currently have guided our endeavors to discern how we become who we are,
Paul Baltes, a contemporary German psychologist, formulated an
overarching lifespan perspective on human development. Understanding the
major features and assumptions of this perspective may especially help
you see the processes of aging in a more positive light.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.4: 1.5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   define what “development” means in the field of psychology;
-   explain three general issues of interest to developmental
    psychologists: universal versus specific change, sequential versus
    kaleidoscopic development, and nature versus nurture;
-   explain the major components (five systems) of Bronfenbrenner’s
    Ecological Systems Theory;
-   identify and explain the major assumptions or tenets underlying
    Baltes’s lifespan perspective on development;
-   identify and describe advantages and disadvantages of the following
    common methods of collecting data: observation (naturalistic and
    controlled), standardized testing, surveys, interviews;
-   explain the difference between correlational and experimental
    research studies;
-   compare and contrast three common types of research designs for
    studying lifespan development: longitudinal, cross-sectional, and
    sequential; and
-   describe why twin studies are particularly useful for gaining an
    understanding of idiosyncratic differences in development.

     Instructions: After clicking on the link above, you will be taken
    to a webpage. Read this page in its entirety to gain an
    understanding of why psychologists study development and what,
    exactly, development means (especially as opposed to “learning”).
    Although this reading is drawn from a text geared specifically
    toward future educators of children, the issues it highlights
    regarding the nature of developmental trends are broadly applicable
    to the study of individuals throughout the lifespan. Note that this
    reading will cover the material you need to know for subunits
    1.1.2-1.1.3. You may also download the PDF or ePub version of this
    text by clicking on the appropriate link under “Download” at the
    bottom of the webpage.   
      
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read the webpage in its
    entirety for insight into one of the central debates of
    developmental psychologists: the role of nature (genetics) versus

    psychologists is that these forces play essentially equally
    important and highly interactive roles in development. You may also
    download the PDF or ePub version of this text by clicking on the
    appropriate link under “Download” at the bottom of the webpage. Note
    that this topic is also briefly touched upon in the reading for

    Theory”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PSYCH302a_Wikipedia_Ecological-systems-theory_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: After clicking on the link above, you will be taken

    and their families. Bronfenbrenner’s theory is one of the most
    influential contemporary developmental theories. To help you
    understand the five systems in his theory, try to identify at least
    three influences within each of those systems on your life as a
    young child.

    theoretical perspectives presented in the reading for subunit 1.2.1,
    there is an overarching framework that broadly guides thinking about
    human development. Paul Baltes was the key formulator of this modern
    “lifespan perspective.” Before you begin reading, think about how
    you expect to grow and change – or not – as you age. Compare your
    own assumptions about development with those of Baltes.
